# The PiRocket Flight Computer

Welcome! This is a project formed in Robert Winglee's *Rockets and Instrumentation* class at the University of Washington. Our goal is to make a high-altitude, high-velocity telemetry and communication computer based on a Raspberry Pi Zero and some Python.

## Goals

We would like to make a high-performance diagnostics and telemetry computer that is available to as many people as possible, and we would like to enable the community to strengthen our work. We chose to prioritize the following goals:

- Accessibility
- Modularity
- Simplicity

And, of course, we would like to make this software open source.

## Contributing

We have a few changes to make before we want anyone to fork our repo. We'd also like to add some design files that are critical to getting the PiRocket up and running. Please stand by until we've gotten these, and then you may fork away.
